#  FLAPPYBIRD IN PYTHON

So once again This my second semi-big project that I'm making practicing what I have learned thus far.
Seeing the Rock-Paper-Scissors game that I made before really made me want to make  graphical game next.

## 1st version
added the main game mechanics 

## Current version
add a derped DLC designe by me because I said that it would be very fun to do. And added some miscellaneous feautures that weren't in the previous version
